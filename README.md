# Advent of Code 2023!

Welcome to my repository for my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges!
These solutions are not supposed to be the most optimal, they're just how I got to the answer.
Enjoy looking around, and remember, don't cheat! Do it yourself first!

**I am not competing for a good score by doing this on release of the challenge, I just do this as and when I can**
